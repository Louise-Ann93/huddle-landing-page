### What I learned

I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge ðŸ˜…

This was my first time using CSS Grid, i've been wanting to experiment with it so learnt it whilst building this landing page. As well as getting stuck in with a responsive design from desktop to mobile was a great challenge.

Below is some of my CSS Grid code
```css
.grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-rows: 1fr;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
		margin: 0 10%;
		column-gap: 5%;
	}

	.inner-grid {
		grid-column: 1;
		grid-row: 1;
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		justify-content: center;
		max-width: 80%;
		color: var(--VeryDarkCyan)
	}
```

Below was my first time validating an email input form by JavaScript
```js
function buttonValidation(email) {
		let element = document.getElementById("subscribe-form");
		let elementError = document.getElementById("email-error")
		let emailFormat = /^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/;

if (email.value.match(emailFormat)) {
			return true;

		} else {
			element.classList.add("invalid");
			elementError.classList.add("email-error");
			document.subscribe.email.focus();
			return false;
		}
}
```
